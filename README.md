## üîå Euchre Game
**Description**:  
This project implements the classic trick-taking card game Euchre in Python, supporting both human and AI players. The program structures the game into distinct components, including player strategies, card objects, game flow logic, trick resolution, and scoring. The AI players use simple decision heuristics to play cards based on their hands and the current trump suit. The game enforces all Euchre-specific rules, such as team play, trump suit logic, left and right bowers, and trick-taking rules. Additionally, the program includes error handling for illegal moves, string-to-object conversions, and complex round logic.

**Key Concepts**:  
- Object-Oriented Design Patterns: Extensive use of class hierarchies for players, cards, and game state to support modular design, encapsulation, and reuse (e.g., Player, SimplePlayer, Card, Pack, Game).
- Custom Rule Enforcement and State Transitions: Implementation of non-trivial game rules such as trump mechanics, trick evaluation, and scoring logic using clean control structures and class methods.
- Strategy Pattern with Polymorphism: Different player behaviors (human vs. AI) are abstracted using polymorphic classes, making it easy to test or swap in new player strategies.
- State Machine Logic: The game engine uses discrete, ordered phases (deal, bidding, playing, scoring) to manage turn-based progression and enforce valid state transitions.

## ‚ö° Terpiez App
**Description**:  
This project is a full-stack Flutter-based augmented reality (AR) game app named Terpiez, where users explore real-world locations to capture creatures. The app includes features like map integration, background location tracking, Redis-based remote data synchronization, local and push notifications, sensor interaction (e.g., accelerometer), and persistent creature data storage. The design also supports gamified elements like stats tracking and personalized creature logs. The app supports background services and secure storage, making it suitable for always-on mobile gaming.

**Key Concepts**:  
- Flutter UI & State Management: Use of widgets, Provider, and global state keys to manage complex UI updates and user interactions across multiple screens (e.g., maps, stats, capture).
- Asynchronous Background Services & Location Tracking: Integration with flutter_background_service, Geolocator, and Redis for continuous data syncing and geo-based triggers even when the app is not in the foreground.
- Secure Persistent Storage & Notifications: Secure data handling using flutter_secure_storage and real-time alerts via flutter_local_notifications, allowing personalized and time-sensitive gameplay experiences.
- Redis Database Communication: Asynchronous read/write operations to Redis allow fast syncing of player data and creature states across devices.
- Custom UI/UX with Flutter Animations: Animated creature cards, transitions, and themed map interactions enhance engagement and provide visual feedback.

## üîß ShareBear App
**Description**:  
Share Bear is a collaborative Flutter application designed to facilitate peer-to-peer task management, idea sharing, and team collaboration through a streamlined mobile interface. It enables users to create, edit, and post ‚Äúshares‚Äù ‚Äî task cards or updates ‚Äî that include titles, tags, and descriptions. Each share is stored in Firestore, enabling real-time updates across all devices. The app supports dynamic user interfaces, tag-based filtering, and asynchronous database operations. It also includes UI components like sliding pages, reusable widgets, and an interactive app bar to ensure a clean, engaging user experience. The focus of the app is creating a supportive and interactive digital community where users can contribute ideas, view others‚Äô contributions, and engage in shared productivity goals ‚Äî all in real-time.

**Key Concepts**:  
- Cloud Firestore Integration for Real-Time Collaboration: The app connects to Firebase's Firestore database to store and retrieve shared items. It supports real-time updates, asynchronous reads/writes, and seamless integration between front-end UI and cloud storage.
- Component-Based UI Design in Flutter: The UI is structured around reusable Flutter widgets, making it easy to display posts (shares), create dynamic forms, and maintain separation of concerns between layout and logic. Screens are modularized for different use cases like posting, browsing, and onboarding.
- Asynchronous State Management & Navigation Flow: Implements Dart‚Äôs async/await patterns to handle Firestore operations and user interactions smoothly. The app features robust routing between onboarding, home, and sharing screens, ensuring a fluid multi-page navigation experience.

## üß† AVR Assembly Projects
**Description**:  
This collection of AVR assembly projects demonstrates basic low-level programming by re-implementing common mathematical and utility functions typically written in C. The code interfaces directly with microcontroller registers and adheres to calling conventions and stack management protocols to simulate recursion and control flow. Projects include:

Each function is tested with dedicated AVR-compatible C drivers and linked into simulated embedded environments. The work demonstrates precise register-level control, performance optimization, and system-level integration for constrained environments.

**Key Concepts:**
- Recursive Function Implementation in Assembly (e.g., fib(n) via stack and register manipulation)
- Register-Level Arithmetic & Bitwise Operations (e.g., bit shifts for isqrt, multiply with mul)
